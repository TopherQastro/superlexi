I'm not exactly sure what you call it when you merge two words together using parentheses to delineate the differences of letters within them. I'm going to call them superlexemes until I have a better answer. Here are a few examples:

addi(c)tive
w(aiv)ed
e(x)ternally

This program creates an exhaustive list of these types of words. It could be searched in some type of dictionary for any possible superlexemes in English.
