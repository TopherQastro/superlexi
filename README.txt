I'm not exactly sure what you call it when you merge two words together using parentheses to delineate the differences of letters within them. I'm going to call them superlexemes until I have a better answer. Here are a few examples:

addi(c)tive
w(aiv)ed
e(x)ternally

These programs create exhaustive lists of these types of words. The file "superlexiMixt.py" creates all possibilities of 5 letters or less in the English language, then inserts them into every word in the library provided in the remezcla project (the entire language, basically) to discover all possible combinations. The "superlexiFullWords.py" does the same, except it inserts full words into others, not just random jumbles.

These lists could be recorded and searched in some type of dictionary for any possible superlexemes in English.
